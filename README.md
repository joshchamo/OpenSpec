# OpenSpec | Premium OpenAPI & Swagger Explorer

**OpenSpec** is a high-performance, professional-grade web application designed to parse, validate, and explore OpenAPI (3.x) and Swagger (2.0) specifications with precision. 

Built for QA engineers, developers, and security analysts, OpenSpec transforms complex API definitions into a readable, searchable, and interactive dashboard in seconds.

🚀 **Live Demo:** [openspec.vercel.app](https://openspec.vercel.app/)

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Advanced Exploration
- **Tag-Based Grouping**: Automatically organizes hundreds of endpoints into logical, collapsible folder categories (e.g., `repos`, `issues`, `users`).
- **Global Search**: Instantly filter endpoints and schemas by path, method, name, or tag.
- **Recursive Schema Tables**: Professional property rendering (Name, Type, Required, Description) consistent with industry standards established by tools like Redoc and Swagger UI.

### 🛠 Professional QA Utility
- **Debug Console**: Real-time logging of the fetch, parse, and dereference lifecycle.
- **Performance Metrics**: Step-by-step timing (+Xms) to analyze the scale and complexity of large specifications.
- **Contract Validation**: Automated **Spec Quality Report** (Linter) that audits specifications for missing documentation, safety gaps (missing error responses), and industry best practices.
- **Download & Export**: Export full quality findings as a **CSV report** for integration with Jira, Confluence, or internal audit documentation.
- **Precision Auditing**: Clearly highlights required fields, enums, and nested data structures with a real-time filtered issue list.

### 🏆 Real-World Impact: The Petstore Audit
During validation of the official [Petstore Swagger 2.0 spec](https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json), OpenSpec identified undocumented success responses on core endpoints including `POST /pet` and `DELETE /pet/{petId}`. While these gaps are silently ignored by standard documentation viewers, they represent genuine API contract issues that break automated code generation and result in incomplete QA test coverage.

### 🌐 High-Scale Support
- **YAML & JSON Support**: Native handling of both formats via robust internal conversion.
- **CORS-Safe Proxying**: Server-side proxying ensures you can analyze specifications from any domain without CORS errors.
- **Industry Examples**: One-click analysis of massive specs like **Cloudflare**, **GitHub**, **Stripe**, and **OpenAI**.
