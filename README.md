## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Advanced Exploration

- **Global Search**: Instantly filter endpoints and schemas by path, method, name, or tag.
- **Recursive Schema Tables**: Professional property rendering (Name, Type, Required, Description) that mimics industry-standard documentation tools like Redoc.

### 🛠 Professional QA Utility
- **Debug Console**: Real-time logging of the fetch, parse, and dereference lifecycle.
- **Performance Metrics**: Step-by-step timing (+Xms) to analyze the scale and complexity of large specifications.
- **Contract Validation**: Clearly highlights required fields, enums, and nested data structures to ensure contract compliance.

### 🌐 High-Scale Support
- **YAML & JSON Support**: Native handling of both formats via robust internal conversion.
- **CORS-Safe Proxying**: Server-side proxying ensures you can analyze specifications from any domain without CORS errors.
- **Industry Examples**: One-click analysis of massive specs like **Cloudflare**, **GitHub**, **Stripe**, and **OpenAI**.
